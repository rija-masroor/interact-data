        Of the 38.5 million people living in Canada, just over 5% identify as indigenous. 
        Of those, more than half identify as part of the First Nations communities, with the rest identifying as part of the Métis or Inuit communities. 
        Only a small percentage of Canadians are considered Inuit; they make up 0.227% of the total population or about 4% of the indigenous population.

    <h2>Scatter Plot</h2>

        Indigenous people comprise larger percentages of the northern provinces, making up more than half of the Nunavut and Northwest Territories population 
        compared to less than 10% of southern provinces such as Ontario and Nova Scotia. The bulk of First Nations and Métis people live in the southern provinces, 
        with First Nations communities centered around Quebec and Ontario and Métis communities located more to the west in provinces such as Ontario and Alberta. 
        The Inuit population exists mainly to the east, especially in the northernmost province of Nunavut.

        Mental health shows a positive correlation with food insecurity in both males and females. 
        Indigenous groups in general have both higher food insecurity rates and worse mental health. 
        Of the indigenous groups, Métis communities show slightly lower food insecurity rates and slightly better mental health in both genders. 
        The Inuit serve as an outlier in that they have much higher food insecurity rates than any other indigenous group, yet are less likely to have poor mental health. 
        In general, males from all groups have less food insecurity and better mental health outcomes than females.
