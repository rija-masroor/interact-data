                <h3>Comparing across two categories</h3>

                <p>If you think elected officials are more like you, do you trust the President more?
                    The data set we are considering from fivethirtyeight asked participants to rate how similar they
                    think elected officials are to themselves on a four point scale, and additionally how much they
                    trust the President on a four point scale (it's probably worth mentioning that this data was
                    collected in 2020). Let's check out two visualizations that show this data.
                </p>

                <img src="image/two_cat.svg" alt="stacked bar and heatmap" class="scalesvg">

                <p>When figuring out which visualization we want to use, we need to consider what we want to draw the
                    viewer's attention to. In the <dfn>stacked bar chart</dfn>, each bar represents one of the potential
                    answers to the question: How many people in elected office are like you? The chunks of each vertical
                    bar show the percentage of people who gave that answer who fit into each of the categories of
                    trusting the President. For example, we see that of those who think only a few elected officials are
                    like them, 37% do not trust the President at all. One trend really stands out on the stacked bar
                    chart: the darkest blue chunk gets larger the more people think elected officials are like them…that
                    is,
                    they trust the President MORE.
                </p>

                <p>The <dfn>heatmap</dfn> is really a glorified table: it is showing the same percentages described
                    above, i.e. the proportion in each group of perceived likeness that fall into each level of trusting
                    the President. The thing that draws our eye first is the darkest blue block in the top left. This
                    might be confusing for viewers…at first glance, we might think 46% is the largest value in the
                    data…but all of those percentages add up to way more than 100%!!! We would definitely need to add
                    some text to explain that the percentages in each column add up to 100%. It’s a lot for the viewer
                    to take in, and the bar chart seems easier to understand. A heatmap would work better if we wanted
                    to show percentages out of the total. What if we have more than two categories?

                <h3>Viewing multiple categories in parallel</h3>

                    <p> A <dfn>parallel categories plot</dfn> shows how observations flow across categories. They can be
                        difficult to read if you've never seen one before! We see how groups of individuals with the
                        same characteristics are distributed over the categories. These plots work well if there are
                        major differences in the groupings. We can also see the relative numbers of individuals in each
                        combined group but also each individual group. Notice that there were actually very
                        FEW people overall who said there were a lot of elected officials like them - most people said
                        only a few elected officials were like them.
